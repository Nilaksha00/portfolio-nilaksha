        I’m a developer who loves creating user-friendly applications that look
        great and work smoothly. I enjoy blending creative design with strong
        technical skills to build experiences that are easy to use and perform
        well.

        Currently, I’m learning more about back-end development with tools like
        Java and .NET to add to my skills in JavaScript and React. This helps me
        build complete solutions that connect the front-end and back-end
        seamlessly.

      <p>
        When I’m not coding, I enjoy watching movies, keeping up with new tech
        and design trends, and exploring hobbies that combine creativity and
        logic.
